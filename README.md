# To-Do List Web App

This is a simple web application that allows users to manage tasks using a To-Do List interface. It consists of two pages: a Date and Time display page and a To-Do List page.

## Features

### Date and Time Page

- Displays the current date and time in a centered container.
- Includes a title "TO-DO LIST" and a subtitle "It's now or never" to give context to the purpose of the application.
- Dynamically updates the date and time every second to show real-time updates.
- Provides a link "Go to Tasks" that redirects users to the To-Do List page.

### To-Do List Page

- Allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, delete tasks, and filter tasks based on their completion status.
- Users can enter tasks in an input field and click "Add Task" to add them to the list.
- Each task is displayed with a checkbox to mark it as completed, a delete button to remove the task, and the time it was added.
- Supports filtering tasks to show all tasks, completed tasks, or uncompleted tasks using a dropdown menu.
- Provides options to clear all tasks or only clear completed tasks.
- Tasks are stored dynamically in the browser's memory and persist across page refreshes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for structuring the web pages.
- CSS: Used for styling the user interface.
